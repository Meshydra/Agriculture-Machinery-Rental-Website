## About
An agriculture website that connects farmers and shops, providing a platform for farmers to sell their crops and for shops to sell and rent machinery. The website includes a loan system to help farmers acquire the resources they need to be successful. With a user-friendly interface, farmers can easily upload their crop information, including quantity and price, and shops can browse the available crops and machinery for sale or rent. The website also includes a messaging system to facilitate communication between farmers and shops, allowing them to negotiate prices and arrange pick-ups or deliveries. With this website, we aim to streamline the agricultural industry and provide a valuable resource for farmers and shops alike.
